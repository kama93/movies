Movie App
=========

In this app I used The Movie Database API, images from Unsplash, react and redux for front-end, node.js for server-side, PostgreSQL for database and bootstrap components. 

Features:
* registration/ sign in- all informations are send/ fetch to database

* on the main website after clicking on one of the genres- it’s going to next page and display movie posters with title and some descriptions, after hovering on the picture it's showing some details and also a heart that after clicking is adding this movie to favorites; there is infinity scroll technique add on this page

* on the main page, there is also a carousel that informs the client about features; after clicking on add to Fav/ check joker it is sending to the proper page

* in the nav, there is the logo- witch after click sending user to the main page

* nav - depends if the user is login or not showing links to log in/ registration/ sign out
